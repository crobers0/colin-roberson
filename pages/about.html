        Hi :) I'm a third-year undergraduate at Purdue University studying CS, Bioinformatics, and Korean.

        I can be happy learning quite about anything, and I hope to learn quite about everything in my lifetime.
        Right now, I'm passionate about machine learning, mathematics, music, education, biology, video games, social and economic justice, tabletop RPGs, literature, visual arts, and foreign languages.
